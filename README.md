Final project for Data Structures
- Implemented A-star and depth first search algorithms in C++
- User can use the maze generator tool to generate a maze of a set size
- User can then use maze solver tool to select an algorithm and find a solution to the generated maze
- Can be visualized using Ryan Nesius's Godot Pacman Visualizer
